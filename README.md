# Easybank Website Demo  
Technologies: Next.js, html-css-js  

## Overview  
This is a Frontend Mentor challenge. I've applied this development challenge in the Next.js environment rather than as a static site written in HTML/JavaScript. The site features UI components, modular CSS designs, and pre-rendered content.  

This site is available to view at [https://visionary-cendol-e005e0.netlify.app/](https://visionary-cendol-e005e0.netlify.app/)  

## Features  
- React components using the Next.js framework  
- Mobile responsive website, following the design of Frontend Mentor  

## The challenge  
Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size  
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
